# Interest rate strategy
Repository for the project in introduction to finance for data scientists.  
The objective is to propose interest rates to a panel of costumers, being in competition with two other banks.  
  
The .csv files have to be put in the data folder.  
They are however not tracked by git so one has to put them manually when using the code for the first time.  
  
To install the needed packages, please run `pip install -r requirements.txt` in the terminal.  
To generate the default probability calculus please run `python3.9 main.py` in the terminal.
